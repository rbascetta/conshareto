## Description
The weekend is approaching and we can't find local music events! All the websites out there are sparse, confusing, and unhelpful. And we can't keep track of what events we're attending! This is a HUGE problem with no known solution.<br><br>
Our app is simple and user friendly. We offer easy access to, and tracking of local music events. This app doesn't seem to exist in an effective format yet. <br><br>
Conshareto is an app that is simple, straight to the point, and user friendly. Search for and track local music events, and keep track of events you're following or attending.
